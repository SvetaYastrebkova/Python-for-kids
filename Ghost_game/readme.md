Write a program that simulates a simple text-based game called "Ghost Game".

In the game:

The player is repeatedly presented with three doors.

One of the doors hides a ghost, randomly chosen each round.

The player chooses a door by typing 1, 2, or 3.

If the player opens the door with the ghost, the game ends.

If the door is safe, the player continues to the next round and earns a point.

At the end, the game displays the total score (number of safe doors opened).
