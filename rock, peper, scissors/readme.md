Create a simple text-based Rock, Paper, Scissors game in Python.

The program should:

Prompt the user to choose between "rock", "paper", or "scissors" (and allow them to type "quit" to exit the game).

Randomly select the computer's choice from the same options.

Compare the user’s choice with the computer’s choice and determine the winner according to the game rules:

Rock beats scissors

Scissors beats paper

Paper beats rock

Print both choices and display the result: win, lose, or tie.

Continue playing in a loop until the user types "quit".
