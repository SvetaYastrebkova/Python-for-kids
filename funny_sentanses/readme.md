Write a program that generates random and funny sentences by combining a random name, a random verb, and a random noun from predefined lists.

The program should:

Select one word from each list (name, verb, noun) at random.

Combine them into a sentence (e.g., "Bob kicks a plane.").

Print the sentence with proper formatting.
